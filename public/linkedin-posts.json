It probably won't. More likely with a good prompt it will be *broadly* relevant and insightful.\nSo here's a twist then.\nYour interview isn't a PM doing a take-home assignment.\nIt is the PM reviewing a 100% AI-generated strategy or plan. Right there on the spot, they are to go through and provide commentary:\n- Show critical thinking when – especially when – the strategy looks plausible and well presented. We're all inclined to submit to a 'professional presentation' backed with data.\n- Show taste and character when insights are OK but not differentiating.\n- Turn a mountain of insights into a cohesive plan that leans onto unique strengths, not just average sensible best practice.\nFor creative tactical thinking, you can always ask them to vibe prototype or sketch out a solution.\nWhat's the current thinking among hiring managers? #PM #Product #productmanagement #AI",

The alternative is lots of frustration, spent tokens and hitting the token limit sooner. Opportunity cost is high, and people would rather ship core functionality than spend all their tokens on making the thing look and work nicely.\nPractical example: I'm toying with a personal fitness app – several agents that collect my data and make daily, weekly, 6-week adjustments. How hard could Material Design 3 Expressive with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose be?\nWow. Very, very hard it seems. Gemini 3, Sonnet 4.5, Codex 5.2, I tried them all. (No Opus though!) With some *serious* context: my UX principles, component design, an Expressive Agent Skill I developed (that includes info from Material 3 website, even from Google's keynote transcript).\nAnd still it is mostly garbage. Functionally correct, design-wise total absolute garbage. I'm not nit-picking here. I mean garbage.\nIf you can make some of these agents deliver \"decent\" quality design, I bet people will use it and pay for it. Good skills are anything that is relatively new, and there isn't a lot of training material online:\n- Material Design 3 Expressive (I'm guessing but the iOS equivalent here too)\n- Agentic patterns (tool calling, reasoning, approvals...)\n- Workflow designers (ReactFlow, visually designing agent loops, integrations...)\nThere must be more. And each of these could easily be 3-5 skills, maybe more. With variations for different styles.\nIn fact, you could make a showcase/marketplace for design skills (before/after) and infuse it with your consultancy CTAs. Getting off track here :)\nWill 2026 see better #agentic #UX and #UI #design? Is that good or bad?

They argue that speed of coding was never the bottleneck (sure) and AI can't solve the speed of decision-making.\nExcept that it can. Whatever an LLM is good at (it's good at more than just coding) can be orchestrated into an agentic framework to reason, make hypotheses, validate them, observe the findings, act, ask the human when needed, and loop until done. Strategy, problem definition and validation, prioritization are not some inherently impossible problems that is just too complex for AI, given the right inputs.\nThe point being, the speed of shipping code is just one use for agentic AI. Speed of data analysis, of competitive analysis, of market research, problem definition, solution shaping, solution testing, prioritization... are all equally enabled by agentic AI. Not necessarily the same agentic AI that powers Claude Code or Codex, but still.\nImplying that the speed of delivery is basically pointless since the bottleneck has always been upstream, is not seeing forest for the trees.

    "text": "TOMORROW: What Can Students Do to Save Democracy? Serbia Shows a Way Forward\nPanel of students from universities in Novi Sad, Novi Pazar, and Belgrade, and a member of a citizens' council from New Belgrade\n⏰ Tuesday Nov 4 at 11am PT\n📍&nbsp;Stanford University (in person) and Zoom (webinar)\nAs democracy faces threats around the globe, what can young people do? In the face of this question, many feel powerless, cynical, or apathetic. This was the case in Serbia, until a unique student movement sprang up and offered a powerful and hopeful answer.\nOn November 1, 2024, the collapse of a railway station canopy in Novi Sad killed 16 people, igniting public outrage as evidence pointed to systemic corruption having caused the deaths. What began as vigils for the victims rapidly transformed into the largest and most sustained protest movement in Serbia's history. At its heart are university students who have adopted a remarkable model of political organizing: horizontally structured, leaderless, yet extraordinarily disciplined. Despite having no central command, they orchestrated hundreds of massive peaceful rallies across the country, including the largest rally the country had seen, drawing more than 300,000 people to Belgrade on March 15, 2025.\nA striking feature of the movement is its strategic clarity. Rather than fracturing over traditionally divisive political issues, students built a broad, heterogeneous coalition united around simple demands: the restoration of the rule of law and democratic institutions. This approach has earned them the support of the majority of the population, a feat that has eluded opposition parties amid Serbia's captured media landscape. Professors, high school pupils, teachers, lawyers, farmers, war veterans and countless ordinary citizens all stepped up to support this movement, in the process rebuilding the consensus in Serbian society.\nAfter months of protests failed to secure accountability from the government, the students decided to take their movement to the ballot box. Rather than nominating themselves, they are assembling an electoral list of experts and professionals for the parliamentary elections they are demanding. In doing so, they have transformed from a protest movement into a major political force unlike anything currently operating in global politics.\nJoin us for a conversation with students and professors from Serbia's protest movement as they share insights from this frontline of democratic renewal.\nhttps://lnkd.in/g_VX75SH",

    "text": "There are two lines of critique against AI coding that miss the bigger picture:\n1. Fast delivery will increase AI slop; Products get bloated.\nFast delivery doesn't mean you have to add net new features. You can refactor existing features more easily. Remove intertwined features that you've been delaying for years. Improve performance of existing features. Make larger scale redesigns.\nThese efforts never get prioritized either due to complexity or relatively low perceived value.\nAI allows you to take on these previously mega efforts, and reduce bloat, tech debt, design debt, feature debt.\n2. The problem now is knowing what to ship.\nWhat a lovely problem. I'm yet to meet a product team that doesn't have a backlog of really cool ideas. Those are now stretched over multiple quarters. Is compressing them down to a single quarter really a problem?\nTo an extent, it's true that this can be a challenge – in some environments more than the others – because the feedback loop doesn't only depend on delivery speed. But it largely does. And when the feedback loop compresses down, knowing what to ship will be more, not less obvious.\nIt's only the teams detached from customers that will look up confused \"what now?\".\n---\nThe tactical, near-term side of prioritization will actually be easier when the feedback loop is faster. All the insights will feed into #AI real-time and with the right tooling, Product Engineering teams will have what they need to make tactical decisions. RIP Product Owner. Hello, #Product Builders.\nStrategy will still be the beautiful creative challenge but with cycle times compressing it will be easier to de-risk our bets, and hopefully, more fun.",

    "text": "The primary value of designers and PMs using AI to prototype isn't about handing PRs off to engineers. They don't want to be handed off code.\nThe value is to reduce one of the 3 product risks we are responsible for:\n- Value risk: Confirm with customers and stakeholders that what you're building will be valuable before anyone writes a line of code. Does it solve a problem? Does it unlock new use cases? Does it make users ask \"when is this going live?\"\n- Usability: Is how you're thinking about this intuitive to users? Can they find it, understand it, get the task done with little friction? Is it easier than the alternatives?\n- Viability: To build a business case it helps if you can *show* and not just tell how a product change moves the needle. How it aligns with GTM or unlock new revenue. By prototyping early you can add substance to purely theoretical arguments.\nThe outcome is not that the engineering team is served with a full working PR to approve, but that they work with fewer assumptions overall and have more confidence they're not just shipping useless product.\nWhether the team can take your PR as a useful artifact or not is an interesting technical, cultural, process problem but mostly besides the point of prototyping.\n#product #productmanagement #ai",

    "text": "Sam Altman has been on a podcast blitz this week. 3 appearances in 5 days, each one a post-Dev Day sermon about the future of intelligence. I went through them all (fine, I read the transcripts) partly out of curiosity, partly out of professional obligation. When the person architecting the next platform shift narrates his thought process in public, you pay attention.\nTakeaways:\n▪️The Verticalization of Intelligence\n→&nbsp;“I was always against vertical integration, and now I think I was wrong about that.”\nOpenAI’s biggest pivot since its founding: the lab is now an empire - building chips, models, and end-user interfaces in one continuous loop. In the intelligence economy, whoever controls compute and energy controls cognition.\n▪️ Strategy as Evolution\n→“Let tactics become a strategy.”\nOpenAI’s R&amp;D is Darwinian. Ship chaos, observe order, scale the mutation. Memory wasn’t conceived as a moat - users made it one. Altman’s genius isn’t foresight; it’s feedback.\n▪️AI Scientists\n→“For the first time with GPT-5, we’re seeing little examples where models are doing science, making discoveries.”\nAltman’s AGI test is novel scientific discovery. Within two years, he predicts AIs will generate publishable research - and soon after, it’ll feel routine. Civilization’s next compounding force:&nbsp;automated invention.\n▪️ Customization Is the New UX\n→“It would be unusual to think you can make something that would talk to billions of people and everybody wants to talk to the same person.”\nChatGPT’s uniformity was naïve. The future: AIs that adapt tone, personality, and worldview to each user - an identity layer that mirrors your cognitive and emotional style.\n▪️Post-Interface Computing\n→“You talk to your device and it does exactly what you want - then gets out of your way.”\nVoice is the natural endpoint of human-AI interaction - ambient, context-aware, invisible. The rumored&nbsp;io&nbsp;device is his post-screen bet: a computer that listens, reasons, acts. He is betting on the disappearance of interfaces.\n▪️ Distribution Moves Inside the Assistant\n→“There will be a new distribution mechanic developers figure out… we’ll learn together.”\nFuture startups will live or die by whether ChatGPT mentions them. It’s not SEO anymore; it’s&nbsp;AIO - Assistant Optimization.\n▪️ The Democratization of Creation\n→“In the first few days, ~30% of users were active creators...”\nAltman sees creativity as universal, just bottlenecked by friction. Sora removes it, turning everyone into a micro-studio. The economics will follow: per-generation pricing for heavy users, rev-share for cameos, maybe ads if it tilts social.\nCompute is the new canvas: 1M downloads in &lt;5 days, faster than ChatGPT.\nAltman’s worldview in one loop:\nBuild → Release → Observe → Scale → Moralize Later.\nHe’s a capitalist empiricist, not a philosopher.\nHe summarizes: “AGI will come; it will go whooshing by… the world will not change as much as you’d think in a big-bang sense.”",

Paste any document and ask what it really does, what impact does it really try to achieve, and you'll see it's about clarity. Look it up on Google Trends too. It trends up starting January 2025.\n2. Verboseness\nThis one is a lot more obvious, but actually harder to alleviate.\nIf you don't manage the length of your AI-assisted content, it erodes trust quickly. It makes people think:\n- You haven't read the content yourself, so why should they?\n- You haven't really thought about it enough to distill it into strong arguments.\n- You are blindly following what LLMs told you, especially if you are also strongly opinionated.\n---\nWhich brings me to my second point.\nIt doesn't matter whether you used an LLM or not. An LLM \"tell\" is not really a thing anymore. Everyone uses AI.\nSo the tell is really more about your skills and effort in using AI, not in whether you used it or not.\nThat's why the em dash tell is mostly irrelevant, and verboseness is the next frontier.\n1. Harder to get right.\n2. More impactful for how your AI content – and your skills with it – is perceived.\nBut guess what, I have a GUIDE for that. 👇\n(I don't actually.

Just look at popularity of agent orchestration SDKs for proof.\nAfter all, if workflows are bad, why not just give one LLM 500 tools and call it AGI? Oh right.

    "text": "The rumors were true. Yesterday, OpenAI launched Sora 2, a next gen video + audio model. It makes clips that look shockingly real, with physics that obey Newton instead of Looney Tunes, and audio synced tightly enough to pass a lip-reading test.\nBut the wild part isn’t the model, it’s the wrapper. Sora 2 arrives dressed as a social app with a vertical feed, remix tools, and a “cameo” feature to drop users into scenes. @[OpenAI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/openai/) is auditioning for @[TikTok](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tiktok/)’s job.\nSure, the tech is very impressive - but it’s the strategic chess behind the launch that captured my attention:\n(1) The Scarcity Play\nSora access is gated by invite codes or prioritized channels (like ChatGPT Pro). The scarcity play is obvious: invite codes = FOMO = viral hype. Silicon Valley has been playing this tune since Gmail.\nBut here, exclusivity doubles as a throttle on chaos. By slowly onboarding users, OpenAI gets a live A/B test on how people will break, abuse, and subvert the system. Every invite code is basically a fuse on a firework: light it slowly, not all at once, or you blow off your hand. It’s not just growth hacking, it’s trust hacking.\n(2) The Copyright Play\nOpenAI also made the quietly radical decision to treat copyrighted material as fair game by default - unless the rights holder explicitly says no.\nTranslation: if you own a movie, a character, a song - congratulations, your IP may now appear in someone’s Sora video unless you tell OpenAI not to. And even then, you might not be able to just say “don’t use anything I’ve ever made.” You’ll need to file takedowns for each work, one by one, like bailing water from a sinking ship with a thimble. Forever.\nIt’s a legal Hail Mary, a moral shrug, and a strategic masterstroke all rolled into one. The brilliance (or cynicism) is that “opt-out” scales. Opt-in never would. And while courts grind through years of lawsuits, OpenAI normalizes the precedent simply by shipping it. The real beneficiaries? Beverly Hills law firms billing $2,000 an hour.\n(3) The Identity Play\nOpenAI is explicitly baking consent into likeness use. To appear in Sora, you first upload a verified “cameo”: a one-time video + audio clip that captures your face and voice. Only then can others use your likeness - and only with your permission. You stay a co-owner, can revoke access, and get notified whenever you’re dropped into a scene.\nIt’s a meaningful attempt to center consent in synthetic identity. But it also opens a stranger frontier: identity as asset class.\n- Today it’s your friend putting your face in a video for fun.\n- Tomorrow it’s a talent agency managing a portfolio of “digital cameos” for actors, influencers, and eventually you.\nOpenAI didn’t just address deepfake abuse. They opened a market for identity futures. Identity is no longer just protected. It’s packaged, priced, and platformized. You, too, can rent your face for $99/month.

While I don't think it truly does, the incentive is just not there – all the process, tooling, supporting skills, it's all built around humans writing code. Ditching most of it for AI can feel like a regression.\n- Engineers are already waist-deep in the endless stream of tickets to work on. While AI could help, the process typically won't give them time to experiment with AI. Again, there's a 'process that works' and that process is predictable no matter how inefficient. It's how their performance is measured.

The talks involve Serbia's state-owned telecom company, which has systematically worked to silence critical media outlets over the past several years.\nN1, a cable channel, has been the only major TV station providing independent coverage of the recent mass protests against Serbia's increasingly authoritarian government – protests that drew hundreds of thousands, but were either ignored or vilified by all broadcasters with a national operating license. Now, the very investment fund that owns the parent company is apparently discussing leadership changes with a state-controlled competitor that has spent years trying to shut them down.\nBC Partners happens to raise nearly half of its capital from US pension funds - including those for California teachers, New York teachers, Ohio teachers, and NYC police officers. These are retirement savings from hard-working Americans that could end up financing the destruction of the last free voice in Serbian media.\nIn Serbia, N1 rates as the most trusted news brand. When it was dropped by multiple cable providers due to political pressure, people changed en masse to a provider that still carried N1. If BC Partners allows N1's leadership to be replaced under these circumstances, it would be a clear signal that they're willing to appease an autocratic regime at the expense of press freedom. American workers deserve to know their retirement funds aren't being used to silence independent journalism.\nBC Partners' leadership should answer a simple question to their stakeholders: will you be complicit in crushing the last pillar of free media in Serbia?\nhttps://lnkd.in/giGa2_kP",

    "text": "Dumb Product Manager Interview Questions\n----------------\nA short rant here. I see people recommending questions to ask PM candidates to understand their thinking process and assess their skills. e.g. one question that is often recommended looks something like:\n𝗜𝗺𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝗮 𝗣𝗠 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗦𝗽𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗳𝘆. 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘄𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘂𝗲 𝟱𝘅 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝟱 𝘆𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘀?\nThere are many blog posts on PM sites that propose this exact question. Google it. To be honest, I dislike questions like this. They're pointless and of virtually zero value.\nAs much as some Director or VP PM might believe this is going to help them assess that candidate, it won't. Even Daniel Ek (Spotify CEO) can't answer this question.\nFirst of all....Spotify revenues double roughly every five years. They don't 5X. See the chart below. So the question is stupid on it's face.\nSecond, whatever \"logical\" arguments the candidate makes are based on zero analysis and zero understanding of the realities, complexities and challenges Spotify (or any other company) is facing.\nThird, there is so much subjectivity and bias built into how ANY response ANY candidate gives would be evaluated, that the \"discussion\" that ensues with the candidate is more likely to harm them than help.\ne.g. if the candidate doesn't know much about Spotify or is the kind of person who actually wants to have data and understanding about a topic before answering - i.e. the kind of candidate you probably want on your team - they'll often perform terribly in this situation.\nAnd whether it is Spotify or some other company (Apple, Tesla, Facebook, Dyson etc), it doesn't matter.\nIf the same question was posed about Apple at the height of their iPod/iTunes era (when Blackberry was king of the smart phones), would ANYONE have said, build a revolutionary smart phone that will own 60% of the entire smart phone market, destroy Blackberry, and drive over 50% of Apple's revenue?\nAnd if they did, what do you think the interviewer would have thought of that answer?\nSo let's stop asking these kinds of questions, and be more thoughtful and diligent in our hiring processes. Let's use questions that actually assess important attributes of the candidates we interview. We owe them that much. And it will only benefit ourselves as Product Leaders and our companies.\nP.S. I have some views on take home interview exercises as well. 😀",

The potential of AI.\nAll of these things speak to purpose, hope, possibilities, and opportunities. They talk about fulfillment, career enhancement, and purpose.\nThe Reality (For Many) 🔥\nMultiple rounds of layoffs (amidst record profits). Truly hurtful hiring practices (\"Oh whoops, we've decided to restructure, offer rescinded, thanks for the 3hr assignment\"). Thoughtless RTO mandates. Same old corporate doublespeak in all companies—startups, 100y enterprises, and everything in between. Tech CEOs are saying dumb, insensitive things that are so predictably biased that it hurts to listen. Gaslighting is in full effect.\nA rapidly declining sense of loyalty in companies. We're still working through the trauma of the pandemic. The climate change news is terrifying. Global conflict. A reported epidemic of loneliness (here in the US).\nWe're bombarded by a full range of perspectives on AI, from blind AI fan-boy enthusiasm all the way to complete Luddism and genuine fear for jobs and everything in between. Across the spectrum of companies, regardless of maturity, we're hearing about things that are not good, or at least not as good as we thought (or wanted to believe).\nThe Advice... 🔇\nAnd then you have people dealing with all this in their own way or trying to help others,\n-Give them a version of harsh truth / tough love in an effort to help.\n-Help them be more resilient, accepting, and pragmatic.\n-Support their job search and analyze the current job market. Discuss how roles will change or not change.\n-Urge people to adapt their skills and encourage companies to transform.\nThey are all doing what people do for the most part, which is trying to help in their own way. But sometimes it isn't landing. There's a deluge of coping advice.\nMy realization… 🤔\nPeople are tired. People feel in limbo. People are questioning themselves, their companies, and their craft. It's not the rate of change that is truly gripping people, it is the tension of the change.\nIt is crucial to be empathetic, sensitive, and helpful in genuine ways. Our default ways of helping may not even be helpful right now, so it's important to be super self-aware. We all need someone to listen and not lecture.\nI've written, taught, spoken, and drawn infographics for many years about good products, high-performing teams, feature factories, and continuous improvement.

Dismissing synthetic research simply as \"BS research\" is an overreaction unless we talk about the underlying data first.\nAt the same time, GenAI practitioners (often people with little or no user research experience) can get overly excited by the prospect of just prompting an LLM and getting something convincing in return. Cool story, but not actionable user research.\n𝗕𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗲𝘀.\nThe sweet middle point is what I find interesting.\nFine-tuning a model with a large enough corpus of customer data teaches the model the nuance of what *your* customers say and do. Sales calls, customer interviews, surveys, key behavioural data, G2 reviews etc.\nIncorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems allows for real-time access to customer data, which also decreases hallucination and increases relevance of the model.\nContinually testing the model for bias and accuracy gives some level of quality control. LLM testing and monitoring tools are emerging in this space.\nSo now imagine a model or models that are fine tuned on all that local data, monitored for accuracy and bias, accessible to everyone in the company. Is running simulations a crazy idea? Probably not, but we don't know yet.\n𝗦𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝘁𝗿𝗮 𝘁𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀:\n– Why do this even? Why not just hire researchers?\n– What would the sweet spot be between researchers who command these models and size of the organisation?\n–&nbsp;Orchestrating the entire stack, teaching people new skills and changing processes are all high risk for most companies. Off the shelf tools will likely suck for a while more.\n– Is calling it a \"synthetic\" user research the right taxonomy if it's fine tuned to local data? Probably is, due to generative nature but is that the strongest argument?\n– This is already a part of the product strategy for many tools that process customer data. We're early, but combining all that data into a \"user research bot\" isn't far-fetched – it's coming. Sorry if that's triggering. Will it really work? Maybe... maybe not.\n– While LLM bias is real, so is our human bias too. Have you tried addressing it first? Yeah, it's hard.\n– Why is synthetic data on top of language statistics different to synthetic data on top of e.g. healthcare patient data statistics? Largely due to lack of transparency and control. What if we regained (some of) transparency and control with future niche open source models and tooling?\nJust to be clear: I don't think at this point anyone is going to be replaced with this. But the tech has a potential to address some known problems for product teams. (Stale personas anyone? No UXRs anyone? Difficult access to customer data anyone? A *ton* of customer bias among the teams anyone!?)\n#productmanagement #product #userexperience",

Lemkin that I wanted to highlight.\nWhile freemium comes with its own set of problems especially if you have no strategy on what to do with free users (user-generated content, reviews, path to upgrade etc), it's still true that the free plan forces you to improve quality in a few aspects:\n–&nbsp;Self serve onboarding. Can users experience value without being hand-held by customer success? Is the product intuitive to new users? Can they set up their accounts and be successful on day 1? How does the product support both simple and complex use cases, and different use cases altogether?\n– Self serve help. Can people learn about features and configurations on their own? Is documentation accessible and comprehensive? Are there contextual help mechanisms to help users out if they are stuck? What about user guides or \"Academy\" for long-tail outcomes?\nEven if you don't go for freemium, you can adopt aspects of self-serve as a way to improve product quality across the board. It makes your sales-led onboarding easier, helps you scale, helps retain and make customers happy.\n---\nDoes your team need a UX-minded PM to lead an effort like this? I'm looking for my next role in product and love tackling these problems.\nAt @[aleno](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aleno-ag/) this was practically my entire mission: make the product more self-serve to improve quality, reduce the customer success effort and contribute to sustainable company growth.

(Links in comments) This should not take more than a few days for a single engineer and they will be able to tweak everything from the embeddings model, vector index, similarity, and most importantly have the full insight into how an article is split, vectorised, searched, fed to the LLM.

The benefit is that there’s more of pressure to rewrite articles since you have a set deadline to deploy the bot. However, this coupling makes things more complex, especially if you don’t already have a good content process/pipeline. Assess your content first. Stage 1, focus on improving it since it will take a lot of effort. Then stage 2 build the bot and focus on refining the content while testing for different questions.\n– 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐚 𝐭𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐬𝐞𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬.\nThis is hard because there’s lots of unknown unknowns. For example, minor rewording of questions will give different results. Or question in one language gives a great answer, but gives no answer in another language. (Is your content multi-lingual?

    "text": "As I’m leaving my current role at Aleno, I wanted to reflect on a few things we accomplished during my time.\nMy mission was to demonstrate how a strongly sales-led organisation can benefit from adopting aspects of a self-serve product experience. The long game was a path towards Product-Led Sales. (#PLS)\n–&nbsp;In one instance, we added integration nudges to key contextual places in the app. This increased the # of leads for an integration from ~1/week to about 6/week. We turned it from a mostly outbound motion to inbound –&nbsp;with new leads coming in almost daily.\n–&nbsp;In another instance I turned a manual, customer success-heavy process into a completely self-serve one. It exposed a revenue-generating feature to ~15x more people while completely removing the manual workload of enabling it. Cool thing? It was way easier than I thought.\n–&nbsp;I also put my UX hat on to prototype a complete revamp of the reservation user flow. I combined internal insights, data and some good old design experience to overcome years of design debt, and then validated it with in-person usability tests in Munich.\n–&nbsp;I learned a ton about retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as we integrated a Q&amp;A bot. I love tinkering with GenAI and so exploring the ins and outs of RAG was fun. I'll post more about this too.\nMy big takeaway is just how interesting the path towards Product-Led Sales is. It’s hard, it takes breaking down silos, it touches down on every aspect of how the organisation works, how it builds and how it thinks about interacting with customers. It’s a marathon, with learning points all along the way.\nIf your team is looking for a wide T-shaped, entrepreneurial PM who loves technology and has a good mix of UX, data and PM experience, feel free to DM or email at darko.stanimirovic@gmail.com\nI'll be sharing more specific learning points about some of these over the coming days –&nbsp;follow if you like.\n#product #productgrowth",

If you need to hire more support to onboard more customers, good luck with growth.\n– It makes new tech adoption harder because purely technical refactors are not going to be prioritised. This may or may not be significant to your case, but does limit your options.\nThere's so many side effects of just pushing out feature after feature and not truly looking back. But why does this problem even exist if addressing it comes with so many benefits?\n–&nbsp;It seems risky to remove features as there's always someone using them,\n–&nbsp;It seems risky to have bigger revamps since you already \"can\" sell what you have or at least that's what you believe,\n–&nbsp;There's so many small tweaks you could do, so it sounds right to address those (50 little changes) first before doing anything big and risky.\n– Bigger changes are easy to dismiss when they seem \"way too big, 1 year to build at least\".\nWhen you let poor product practice creep in, eventually it slows you down and it gets harder and harder to stay competitive.

    "text": "I love my product brief templates but there's a fatal flaw: creating briefs only when you have a solution in mind.\nTypically, briefs are split into a problem/opportunity section and a solution section. So far so good. 💪\nUntil it turns out you only create product briefs when you are set on a specific solution.\nThis can lead to a few problems:\n–&nbsp;You waste time back-filling the brief with the problem section. Unless the problem space can challenge that one specific solution, why waste everyone's time?\n–&nbsp;If you're lucky, the team will question your problem space. But if you're set on a solution this will be an awkward discussion.\n–&nbsp;You hurt the trust between Product and other functions when your brief becomes fluff. You may not see it, but it will happen.\nYou can see this when the Jobs To Be Done is just a rephrased user story. When the Data / Insights section is consistently empty or contains fluff such as \"we have observed that [...]\". Or when people simply remove entire sections from the brief. ✨\nIn my experience this can easily happen when there's a disconnect between an aspirational state of the product culture and where it really is in practice. The brief is where you want to be, but it's not enough to get there.\nI don't have a tested solution here but some thoughts:\n–&nbsp;Create briefs before you have a solution. This is tough to impossible depending on the setting since problem statements often circulate in the hallways. No one says \"that's a great problem, let's collect all we know about it in one place\". It floats around until some people agree on solutions, and then it goes into the brief. (Lack of UXRs anyone?)\n–&nbsp;Split the briefs into two separate documents: \"Problem/Opportunity Brief\" and \"Solution Brief\". Might be perceived as \"too much process\" depending on the context.\n–&nbsp;Take an unbiased look into your discovery process. Do you just take one or two comments from support to prioritise a feature? Is your team empowered to participate in some way, or do they just wait for tickets? A formal brief in an informal setting won't be enough to nudge the culture in the direction you want.\n–&nbsp;Be OK with some solutions not needing a lot of discovery. Don't back-fill with fluff, just explain as it is. If the opportunity is to build a team invitation system, a common table-stakes B2B feature, perhaps it doesn't need as much discovery as \"Use GenAI to make our customers 20x efficient\".\nHave you seen or contributed to fluffy product briefs too? Designers and Engineers, looking at you. Do you feel that the problem space is just theatre play to satisfy a template or make the PM feel smart?

This is where at the start of the quarter I take our planned initiatives and allocate certain amount of time for each.\n\"How can you estimate the time we need to build this if even we don't know!?\"\nIt's not a time estimate though. It's a time investment.\nEvery quarter you get around 12 weeks to invest into different bets. A problem with just going at it one at a time is that you lose a sense of time and can easily overspend on an initiative, pushing other ones out of the quarter. This creates a mess for the following quarter, and damages morale.\nI learned this way back in art classes. Your paper is the space you operate in (a quarter in our case).\nIf you start drawing a sitting person by\ndetailing the nose,\nthen the eye,\nthen the neck,\nand the body,\nby the time you get to the leg you'll realise it won't fit.\nAnd you kinda wanted the leg too.\nThat's why you sketch it first in broad strokes –&nbsp;you allocate roughly where things should go and how much space they need.\nI hadn't really seen this before and thought I was improvising a process too much, but then I found it's also at the core of Shape Up by Ryan Singer, and has a better name: appetite.\n\"When shaping, we focus less on estimates and more on our&nbsp;appetite.&nbsp;Instead of asking how much time it will&nbsp;take&nbsp;to do some work, we ask: How much time do we want to&nbsp;spend?

Detecting speakers with diarization would probably solve this, but since the interviews were still fresh in my memory, I could notice this and nudge ChatGPT in the right direction.\n- This was fun but there's probably an open source tool out there that can do this already at the bare-metal price, I just didn't bother enough to find it. Google Cloud Speech-to-Text has a more complex workflow but could remove the need to split the audio. I valued simplicity in this case.\n- You really have to know the interview to chat with it effectively. Otherwise ChatGPT will minimise points it should not or entirely skip things that matter.

Two days later, he had a new leadership opportunity at Microsoft.\nI'm certain he felt betrayed. The shock, anger, and anxiety must have been nearly impossible to stave off. Yet, he persisted and made his best available moves, when he had every right to sulk for a few days.\n2️⃣ Trust is everything.\nIt's clear to me that Greg has incredible amounts of organizational and personal trust.\nWhen news about Sam broke, everyone was in a holding pattern. Rumors were flying about what Sam could have done to justify removal (Safety, AGI, conflict of interest). When Greg announced his departure, the conversation changed.\nThe board came under fire. Employees declared they would leave if the change was not reverted. That's the type of reputation that can only be earned through years of integrity and leadership.\nGreg's resignation was the catalyst that got 95% of OpenAI staff vocally behind them. That speaks volumes to the kind of leaders he and Sam are, and how much the OpenAI team trusts them.\nSam and Greg can ONLY have uno-reversed this board coup with this much trust.\n3️⃣ Microsoft \"can't lose\".\nIn spite of Satya's mild demeanor and PC tone, Microsoft really held all the cards. It has ~49% ownership of OpenAI, it has licensing to OpenAI's tech assets (e.g. models), and provides a significant amount of compute credit that OpenAI needs in order to operate.\nIf Sam and Greg go to Microsoft, they can hit the ground running. They would likely bring a significant swing of talent to Microsoft (more than just OpenAI talent). OpenAI's value would sharply decline, and the board would have no company to oversee.\nIf Sam and Greg go back to OpenAI, they can continue their mission toward AGI as a separate entity. They would ensure governance changes so nothing like this happens again. With that firm grasp on the company, they won't forget that Satya and Microsoft had their backs during this time.\nIf you enjoyed this, follow me Derek Yang for more.\n#artificialintelligence #openai #microsoft",

    "text": "ChatGPT wrappers are starting to feel the pain of not having a vertical advantage.\nIncumbents are hard to disrupt since they already own the workflows, have a great UX, have money to burn, and embedding GenAI into those workflows is seamless.\nAs Sangeet Paul Choudary points out in his 2-part series on Losing and Winning with GenAI (links in comments), wrappers are poorly positioned to win:\n- No pre-existing PMF to subsidise the cost of GenAI,\n- No other vertical advantage,\n- Mediocre workflow UX.\nThe recent expansion of ChatGPT into native PDF support is a good example.\n- \"Chatting with PDF\" is a great use case for embeddings. But it is so close to the capability of a foundational model that you'd have to provide additional value *fast* if you want to protect yourself.\n- Wrappers are trying to take a horizontal model (good at everything but not truly great at anything) and take it to a vertical. However, PDF embeddings aren't exactly a vertical, which made it extremely easy, even necessary for the foundational model provider to own it. The fact that PDF wrappers didn't see it coming isn't surprising given the GenAI gold rush.\n- Perhaps traditionally, plugin marketplaces don't go competing with their plugins very often. I think this is because the path to a platform is a long one, and the company has usually figured out main use cases by then. For @[OpenAI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/openai/), or specifically ChatGPT, this path was extremely short. For comparison, it took @[Figma](https://www.linkedin.com/company/figma/) 6 years to move into a platform, and it took ChatGPT *5 months*.\n- Whether it was intentionally built as a data mining strategy to see emerging use cases and then bundle them in, or not, is hard to say. Looking back, building your core value proposition on top of a steaming hot tech, embedding it within the model provider's platform and creating no other vertical advantage was perhaps not meant to succeed.\n* LinkedIn releases AI assistant for job applications * (link in comments)\nAnother great use case. Job searching is extremely painful and slow. Simple AI wrappers won't cut it because AI applications are easy to see through. You need a strong vertical advantage and a great UX to win. Incumbents like LinkedIn are deeply positioned to win here. Even beyond matching \"CV\" and job ad, LinkedIn can match an applicant's posts history to bring the nuance into the process. (E.g. \"this applicant frequently writes about onboarding and UX, both of which are stated as important in your job ad.\")\nFor wrappers to create this vertical advantage, Sangeet Paul Choudary offers a playbook:\n1. Sophisticated prompt engineering + Well-crafted UX drives Workflow engagement.\n2. Workflow engagement drives rich data capture.\n3. Data capture aids model fine-tuning.\n4. A fine-tuned model drives greater workflow engagement.\nBuilding a #genai wrapper but lacking on #uxdesign? Want to explore how #genai can boost your PLG onboarding? Reach out.",

It's only going to be used by LLMs as well as people.\nAll in all, it should be a net gain, not loss:\n–&nbsp;LLMs can generate documentation for us, or assist in the process. The dreaded writing process will become more of an instruction-review-feedback loop with an LLM. This can be great if it results in more/better documentation written overall.\n–&nbsp;The final documentation will live on, but how we measure success (page visits, \"X people found this helpful\") will need to adapt. Perhaps there will be ways to test the quality differently –&nbsp;either checklists (like \"has version-specific documentation\") or some version of accessibility tests which would help LLMs understand information more accurately (e.g. comparison tables use either text values or images/SVG with aria values, and not plan images) or a more advanced test, like making sure information is structured well enough for embeddings to be effective.\n–&nbsp;The layer between the documentation and someone's specific problem will largely get replaced by an LLM. Not great for StackOverflow but pretty cool for engineers. So it's more about the middleman than the documentation itself.\nAs an example, I PoC'd a Zapier app recently for the first time, never before reading Zapier's docs and never using our own product's GraphQL API or even writing a line of GraphQL before.\nThat internal GraphQL API documentation was the absolute enabler for the fast PoC. I still had to consult both documentations and of course use my own logic, but the approach made me at least 3x efficient, due to my non-existent previous experience with either ends of the integration.\nI say the documentation is here to stay, but many things will change.

You know it, or the team member with the longest tenure knows it, but no one else does.\nAgain, the problem isn’t being data-driven. Your poor data culture makes business critical insights a personal knowledge trophy of hard to reach individuals.\n＊ 𝗪𝗲 𝗸𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗴𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀-𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀 ＊\nThis is not an uncommon problem, but usually it’s a symptom of:\n– Toxic blame culture that discourages people from making decisions with just enough data.\n– Unclear goals which make people dig into data without a clear outcome in mind.\n– Lack of a decision-making process.\nMost of the time you’re looking at a non-intentional, poor data culture.\nLike any culture, it already exists and you probably don’t create it consciously. Yet everything you do around data is shaping it.\nIf it’s not intentional, it can take all kinds of shapes and forms as you scale – as evident in the realistic representation of a poor data culture in the attachment.\nNext time, if you see the blame passed to \"data-driven\", probe the culture a bit. I guarantee the outcomes will be more actionable and impactful.\n#product #productmanagement",

    "text": "Do you still start with \"Welcome to [Product Name]\" in your onboarding? You might reconsider.\nThese phrases can feel like filler text, almost saying, \"I wasn't really sure what to put here.\"\nIt's weak because users typically have several questions in mind when they begin.\nHitting them with \"Welcome to [MY_PRODUCT]\" or \"Hello, [FIRST_NAME]\"? That's a direct path to banner blindness.\nBeing welcomed is more about feeling than being told. You can say it, but it doesn’t guarantee the user will FEEL it.\nInstead, they might feel:\n– Lost. \"Where am I? Is this right?\"\n– Confused. \"What's in it for me?\"\n– Annoyed. \"This isn't what I was looking for.\"\nTrue welcoming comes from job alignment and clear progress.\n* Alignment *\nThe product must resonate with the user's specific needs and the job they intend to complete. Alignment gap almost always exists, but can be thoughtfully minimised.\nA disjointed onboarding experience widens this gap. Poorly designed products often completely miss the user's expectations.\n* Progress to the desired outcome *\nIn the Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) theory, users “hire” products to achieve progress towards their desired outcome. If they can't see how hiring your product progresses them further, the big “Welcome, Bob!” won’t do much.\nIt's like mistakenly crashing a party. They might drunkenly exclaim “Welcome to the partey!” but you know you need to get out asap.\nA clear progression path could be as basic as a descriptive headline or a CTA that says “Customize Report” over a vague “Next”.\nSo, next time you're tempted to slap a \"Welcome\" on the screen, pause.\nList out 3 things that would make users FEEL it, so they know they’re at the right party.\nThen craft the message around one of these.\n(And if you hit a snag, ping me.)\n#productmarketing #product",

    "text": "To become a top-notch web designer, the #1 rule is mastery in drawing and painting.\nThat's what I wrote in 2002. I was a \"pro\" web designer, boasting maybe an entire year of experience, mainly building websites for buddies in Macromedia Dreamweaver and Flash. 🤷‍♂️\nI stumbled upon these .doc files in my archive, one of them titled simply: \"What it takes\". 👊\nHere are the main points, with all their authentic typos and grammar:\n– “The first thing that you must have is fondness against visual arts.” 😬\n– “Not only web design, but drawing, painting, photography, modeling, and well, every other form of visual arts.” Cool story bro 🤣\n– “If you dislike, for instance, photography as an art… then I think you should give up”. 📸 Definitely give up. This is a rock solid advice here.\nI couldn't resist but challenge ChatGPT to give my younger self's wisdom a modern twist and see if the message can find a new following.\nSo here's to my younger self. I salute you. 🫡\n---\nSipping coffee one afternoon, I found myself deep in conversation with a friend about the essence of web design.\nHe hit me with a question: \"What truly sets a web designer apart?\" I pondered, and the answer struck me like a flash of inspiration. \"The first thing that you must have is fondness against visual arts,” I remarked.\nBut what does 'fondness for visual arts' really mean? I went on, “Not only web design, but drawing, painting, photography, modeling (not referring to 3D modeling for games ;), and well, all other forms of visual arts.” I caught a look of confusion from him, clearly thinking, \"I’ve no idea what this guy is talking about.”\nBut the deeper I delved into the topic, the clearer it became. 🤯\nAs the hours passed, I touched upon the significance of every art form. \"If you dislike, say, photography as an art... then I think you should give up,” I declared. And while it might sound harsh, it's rock-solid advice, people.\nBecause true web design isn't just about laying out a page; it's about pouring heart, soul, and art into every pixel.\nAs our conversation dwindled and the coffee cups emptied, I felt a renewed sense of purpose. For me, and many like me, the canvas of the web is where art meets function, where passion meets precision. Every site, every page, tells a story - and behind it is a designer letting their love for the visual arts shine through. 🎨💞✨",

    "text": "I bootstrapped 3 startups in 13 years. These are the 8 biggest misconceptions I always hear about bootstrappers: 🧐\n1. We raise $0 external capital.\nUnless founders can avoid hiring, cover startup costs, and sustain themselves till they get to revenue, it’s likely that they’ll need some initial capital. Bootstrapping refers to \"no institutional capital\". Most founders invest their own money and raise from family and friends to get started.\n2. We don't want to give away equity.\nIt took 2.5 hard years in my last startup to make our first $10. A friend said to me, \"It’s okay to raise a bit so you can be comfortable.” thinking I didn’t raise because I wanted to keep all the equity. Reality was, I had complete freedom and didn't want to lose it.\n3. We're less ambitious.\n\"If you don't shoot for unicorn status, you're not ambitious enough.\" is a fallacy fueled by VCs because it's good for their business. Starting a company is in itself ambition. We know success is self-defined, we don't need anyone else to agree.\n4. We're unable to raise capital.\nVC-backed startups must fuel growth at all costs, which forces them into a vicious cycle of constantly raising more. We don't subscribe to that way of life. At least not yet until we know that's what we want. Many bootstrappers raise much later when they can demand favorable terms.\n5. We're cheap.\nWe're cost conscious and optimize for getting the most return on investment. That's not the same as cheap, which means paying the least. We're profit driven, so we can't afford to compromise on time and quality of work. We pay what is needed to get to revenue fastest.\n6. We don't make money for a while.\nWe make money, just not yet on the startup we're bootstrapping. We do whatever it takes to fund our companies. We work on them on the side, take consulting gigs, or agency work.\n7. We have smaller exits.\nWe can sell whenever we want but VC-backed startups can't without board approval and often come with liquidation preferences. Selling a bootstrapped startup at $10m where founders own 90% = $9m. To do better, VC-backed founders need 10% of a $100m exit which is often not big enough for VCs.\n8. We struggle more.\nIt's true that comparatively we struggle more in the initial years. But our struggle ends the day we hit profitability. We don't need to grow at an unrealistic pace to satisfy investors until we sell or die. Profitability gives us the freedom to live and work how we want. 🍾\nMany people think bootstrapping is a financial decision when it's often a lifestyle choice.\nRaising VC, however, is usually a financial decision without consideration for the lifestyle that comes with it.\nThere isn’t a right or wrong way to build a business. But there's a right way FOR YOU.\nThe question founders should be asking before choosing which path to take is not, \"How much money do I want to make from this?\"\nBut rather, \"What kind of life do I want to live while building this for the next 10 years?\"",

    "text": "CALM IS IN THE BLACK\nFrom the very first month we started the business back in 1999, we were profitable. We’ve remained profitable every year since then.\nWe’ve absolutely had our share of good fortune and luck, but we’ve also intentionally never gotten ahead of ourselves. We’ve always kept our costs in check and never made a move that would push us back from black to red.\nWhy? Because crazy’s in the red. Calm’s in the black.\nUntil you’re running a profitable business, you’re always almost out of business. You’re racing the runway. Fretting about whether you’ll take off in time. Worrying about how to make payroll at the last moment if you don’t. Talk about a pressurized environment!\nWhen companies are in the red, employees worry about their jobs. People aren’t stupid—they know that burning cash means the good times won’t last. The possibility of layoffs are always nagging. CVs are always at the ready. And as market sentiments change, valuations shift, and money becomes more expensive, being in the red leads to even more danger ahead.\nRevenue alone is no defense either because revenue without a profit margin isn’t going to save you. You can easily go broke generating revenue—many companies have. But you can’t go broke generating a profit.\nProfit means time to think, space to explore. It means being in control of your own destiny and schedule.\nWithout profit, something is always on fire. When companies talk about burn rates, two things are burning: money and people. One you’re burning up, one you’re burning out.",
